    <p>
      This type of engineering deals with technology and electricity, they
      usually work on the design aspect of electrical components. Electrical
      engineering is very time consuming, meaning it requires people who can
      work through problems. Project management and engineering tasks are very
      important if being an electrical engineer is ideal. Electric engineers
      have contributed to the wide range of technology used today.

    <p>
      An Electrical Engineer works on and tests different electrical systems.
      People in the electrical engineering field apply physics and mathematics
      of electricity to solve problems and process information/transmit energy.
      They keep equipment operational by following the manufacturer's
      instruction. Engineers specifically electrical engineers provide
      engineering information by answering questions/requests.
